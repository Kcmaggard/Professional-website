<h2>My name is Kelly Maggard. I teach 8th grade Language Arts in Lexington. I have 20 years classroom experience and love helping students discover books that speak to them. </h2>
<p>
In addition to teaching, I have held many leadership roles over the years. I have served on SBDM, been Language Arts Department Chair for 8 years, served as Beta Club sponsor, and Academic Team coach. As much as I love my work in the classroom, I also love mentoring other teachers and helping them develop their teaching practice. I believe strongly in the power of collaboration in a school and plan to continue collaborating with teachers throughout the school as a librarian.</p>
<p>
In my personal life, I am a mom to three great kids- all teenagers. I have two dogs who love to sleep all day. I love to read and travel with my family. I have a small bakery business that is currently on hold while I focus on other things, but if you want to check out my past work, you can see my cookie creations by visiting <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/alwaysbringcookies/" target="_blank"> Always Bring Cookies </a> on Instagram!</p>
